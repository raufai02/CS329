Example Output:

U: Tell me about a project you are working on currently:
S: As a software engineer, I am always working on personal coding projects to improve my skills and knowledge. Currently, I am working on a project that involves building a web application using the latest web technologies such as ReactJS and NodeJS. The application aims to help users manage their personal finances by offering a range of features such as budget tracking, expense analysis, and investment suggestions. To accomplish this, I have been reading up on financial management strategies and applying them in the development process. I am particularly excited about this project because it allows me to combine my technical skills with my personal interest in financial planning.
U:Why are you programming in Javascript?
S: I'm programming in JavaScript because it is one of the most widely-used programming languages for web development, particularly on the client-side. It offers a lot of versatility and flexibility in terms of what you can build with it, and it has a large and active community that supports its development and offers a lot of resources for learning and problem-solving. Additionally, as a software engineer, it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and trends, and JavaScript is definitely one of those.
U: How do you handle situations when you have to work independently without clear guidelines?
S: When I have to work independently without clear guidelines, I usually start by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. I try to identify the goals and objectives of the project and create a plan to achieve them. I then set up a framework or architecture that I think will work best for the project, and begin coding. Throughout the process, I frequently check my progress against the goals I set and make adjustments as necessary. If I encounter any issues or obstacles, I take a step back and try to identify the root cause, and then come up with potential solutions. I also like to get feedback from colleagues or mentors when possible, as having an outside perspective can be very valuable. Overall, I try to stay organized and focused, and constantly re-evaluate my progress to make sure I'm on the right track.
